  Time range indicator

  Notes:

    1 - For analysis products, or the first of a series of analysis products,
        the reference time (octets 13 to 17) indicates the valid time.

    2 - For forecast products, or the first of a series of forecast products,
        the reference time indicates the valid time of the analysis upon
        which the (first) forecast is based.

    3 - Initialized analysis products are allocated code figures distinct
        from those allocated to uninitialized analysis products.

    4 - Code figure 10 allows the period of a forecast to be extended over two
        octets; this is to assist with extended range forecasts.

    5 - Where products or a series of products are averaged or accumulated,
        the number involved is to be rep resented in octets 22 and 23 of
        Section 1, while any number missing is to be represented in octet 24.

    6 - Forecasts of the accumulation or difference of some quantity (e.g.
        quantitative precipitation forecasts), indicated by values of 4 or 5 in
        octet 21, have a product valid time given by the reference time + P2;
        the period of accumulation, or difference, can be calculated as P2 P1.

    7 - A few examples may help to clarify the use of Code table 5: For analysis
        products, P1 will be zero and the time range indicator will also be zero;
        for initialized products (sometimes called zero hour forecasts), P1 will
        be zero, but octet 21 will be set to 1.

        For forecasts, typically, P1 will contain the number of hours of the 
        forecast (the unit indicator given in octet 18 would be 1 - and octet 21
        would contain a zero.

        - Code value 115 would be used, typically, for multiple day mean forecasts,
          all derived from the same initial conditions.

        - Code value 117 would be used, typically, for Monte Carlo type calculations:
        many forecasts valid at the same time from different initial (reference) times.

        Averages, accumulations and differences get a somewhat specialized treatment.
        If octet 21 (Code table 5 - has a value between 2 and 5 (inclusive), then the
        reference time + P1 is the initial date/time and the reference time + P2 is
        the final date/time of the period over which averaging or accumulation takes.

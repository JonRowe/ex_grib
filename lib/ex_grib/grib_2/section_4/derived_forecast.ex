  Table 4.7

  Derived forecast

  Notes:

  1. Large anomaly index is defined as (number of members whose
  anomaly is higher than 0.5*SD) - (number of members whose anomaly is
  lower than -0.5*SD)}/(number of members) at each grid point.

  SD is the observed climatological standard deviation.

  2.Â It should be noted that the reference for "minimum of all ensemble members"
  and "maximum of all ensemble members" is the set of ensemble members and not a time
  interval and should not be confused with the maximum and minimum described by
  Product Definition Template 4.8.

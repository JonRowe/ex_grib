  Type of time intervals

  Notes:

  1.Â Code figure 5 applies to instances where a single time subinterval was used
  to calculate the statistically processed field.

  The exact starting and ending times of the subinterval are not given, but it is known
  that itb is contained inclusively between the beginning time and the ending time of
  the overall interval.
